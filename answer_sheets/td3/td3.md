#### Step 1

###### Describe the shapes and positions of the (pre-?)segmented objects.

The objects are non-convex, and one of them has holes.
The pictures capture the objects at the centre of the frames, each with a different rotation around their approximate geometric centre.

#### Step 2

Notes:

- We chose the adjacency pair (4, 8), because we do not have any obvious connectivity issues or with the binary image: it is well-composed.
