### Experiments

#### Step 1

#####  Observe segmented images

###### Characterise the general grain shape of each rice type.

We see that japanese rice is more curvy and round, 
bismati rice is long and thin, while camarague rice is somewhat halfway
in between.  

#### Step 2

###### See whether the images are well-composed

I could not find evidence of ill-composition with the digital object,
since it is a pixel-perfect import from the image (which itself is well-composed.)
There are some errors with the boundaries between grains, however.

###### Eliminate the grains which are partly out of frame.

We use the greedy predicate that a grain is out of frame if its boundary
is in contact with the rim of the domain.
It does not remove all faulty grains, for some reason.

#### Step 4
